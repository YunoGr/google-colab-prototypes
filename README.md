# Google Colab Prototypes

Welcome to **Google Colab Prototypes** - a collection of quick machine learning projects and experiments built using Google Colab. This repo is a playground for fast, lightweight, and exploratory ML work.

---

## About

These notebooks serve as prototypes, proofs of concept, or small-scale experiments. The focus is on rapid iteration and testing ideas rather than production-ready code.

If any project proves valuable or matures beyond prototyping, it may be cleaned up and moved to its own dedicated repository.

---

## Features

- All projects run smoothly in Google Colab with minimal setup
- Focus on experimentation with datasets, models, and ML techniques
- Lightweight and easy to fork or clone for your own experiments

---

## Getting Started

1. Open any notebook (`*.ipynb`) directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run the cells sequentially — no additional setup usually required
3. Modify and experiment as you like!
