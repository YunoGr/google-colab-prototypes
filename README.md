# Google Colab Prototypes

Welcome to **Google Colab Prototypes** - a collection of quick machine learning projects and experiments built using Google Colab. This repo is a playground for fast, lightweight, and exploratory ML work.

---

## About

These notebooks serve as prototypes, proofs of concept, or small-scale experiments. The focus is on rapid iteration and testing ideas rather than production-ready code.

If any project proves valuable or matures beyond prototyping, it may be cleaned up and moved to its own dedicated repository.

---

## Features

- All projects run smoothly in Google Colab with minimal setup
- Focus on experimentation with datasets, models, and ML techniques
- Lightweight and easy to fork or clone for your own experiments

---

## Getting Started

1. Open any notebook (`*.ipynb`) directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run the cells sequentially â€” no additional setup usually required
3. Modify and experiment as you like!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Raw and processed datasets
  - `raw/`: Raw, unprocessed datasets
  - `processed/`: Cleaned or processed datasets

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling
  - `exploration/`: Data exploration, visualization, and initial analysis
  - `modeling/`: Machine learning model training, evaluation, and tuning

- **`src/`**: Python scripts for data loading, model building, and utilities
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for cleaning and preparing data
  - `model_utils.py`: Functions for model training, evaluation, etc.

- **`outputs/`**: Results, visualizations, and other output files
  - `figures/`: Graphs, charts, or visualizations generated during analysis
  - `predictions/`: Model predictions, output files, or submission files (e.g., Kaggle submissions)
 
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests for the project (optional)
  - `test_model.py`: Example tests for model functions or scripts

- **`docs/`**: Documentation and architecture notes
  - `architecture.md`: Optional overview of the project's architecture or design decisions

- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies for running the project locally
- **`README.md`**: Main repository description and instructions
